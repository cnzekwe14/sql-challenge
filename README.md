The data is based on people who were employed during the 1980's and 1990s at Pewlett Hackard.

Six CSV files were analyzed which were departments, employees, salaries, titles, department managers and department employees.
  

An Entity Relationship Diagram was created to get the primary and foreign keys.  Along with the keys, lines connected each table to get the one to one, one to many and many to many relatinships.  This information was the base to create the tables into Postgresql.

The CSV files were imported to Postgresql to retreive specific employee, manager and departmental information.
